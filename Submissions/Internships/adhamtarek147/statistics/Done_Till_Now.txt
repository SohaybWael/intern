1- Descriptive Statistics:
        .Qualitative and Quantitative Data
        .Measures of Central Tendency (mean, median and mode)
        .Measures of Dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation and coffecient of variance)
        .Graphs like histogram, pie chart and bar chart and dot chart

2- Pre - Infrential Statistics
	.Probability
	.Random Variables
	.Expected Value
	.Distrubutions (Bernolli and Binomail => Discrete Random Variable and Normal Distrubusions = > Continuous Random Variable)
	.Z Scaling of Normal Distrubusions Graphs

3- Infrential Statistics:
	.Sampling Methods
	.Central Limit Theorem

4- Hypothesis Testing:
	.Formulation of Hypothesis
	.Testing Using Z-Test and T-Test (Based on The Conditions of The Problem)
