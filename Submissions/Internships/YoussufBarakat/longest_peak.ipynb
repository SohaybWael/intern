At least three integers are required to form a peak.\n","\n","For example, the integers `1, 4, 10, 2` form a peak, but the integers `4, 0, 10` don't and neither do the integers `1, 2, 2, 0`. Similarly, the integers `1, 2, 3` don't form a peak because they aren't strictly decreasing after the `3`.\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:2px\">\n","\n","<center>\n","    <H3>\n","        Sample Inputs & Outputs\n","    </H3>\n","</center>\n","\n","Sample input(s) and output(s) are given below.
